# The-Sheet-Show

## What is the point of this app?
This app was designed to help players create a character by using a list or "sheet" of characteristics, similarly to how popular RPG/simluation games allow you to create a character at the start. When the user has created their character, this character and their information is saved inside a mySQL database and can be accessed again when the user logs into the website.
The real-world application of this app could be used for a myriad of different game sites, and could be customizeable based on the ideas of the developers.

## How did we build this app?
Our team (Erik Platcha, Connie Barrantes, Chris Morales, Mary Margaret Lawton), divvyed up the responsibilities based on what our strong suits were.
1. To start, we build out the most basic files and their structures (Handlebars, character models, routes)
2. Next, we looked into the character styles and images we wanted to use for the app. We found a few APIs that we wanted to use, and looked into additional technologies we could incorporate
3. We handled and created some of the algorithms and logic for the characher ability scores, modifier calculations and proficiency bonuses. These mimiced rolling dice as it would in the DND game.
